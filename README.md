# OTT Platform "My List" Feature - Developer Evaluation Project

Welcome to the OTT Platform "My List" feature evaluation project. This project is designed to assess your problem-solving skills, debugging abilities, and overall proficiency in improving an existing codebase. The project is built using [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/), and your task will involve refining the current implementation and adding new features.

## Changes Made :
1. Implemented all the list apis => GET list , POST list , DELETE list.
2. Added authentication logic as well via an auth gaurd which validates the api call . This auth gaurd is only active on list controller
3. Also added user creation (registration) and user verification (login) flow.
4. Fixed seeding issue.
5. Fixed date string issue
6. Wrote modular and cleaner code.
